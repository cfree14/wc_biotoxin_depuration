Domoic acid data

-“ASP ug/g” = amnesic shellfish poisoning micrograms per gram = domoic acid parts per million (ppm).

-The “Mod” data field before the biotoxin value field is a modifier field that should be added in front of the biotoxin value (IE. <2.5 ppm domoic acid).

-Mussel and oyster samples are homogenates of at least 12 or more individuals. Other species of shellfish may not contain this minimum number.  

-Sample station coordinates are approximate. These have not been QCd or ground-truthed and may be incorrect. 

- Only a portion of the commercial growing areas are tested for domoic acid routinely. For other areas it is usually event driven based on presence of Pseudo-nitzschia.

-The shellfish growing area samples are generally collected weekly. There may be some breaks in data due to an area being temporarily closed for a variety of reasons.

-The non-commercial sample sites are not sampled on a routine basis. Volunteer sampling is sporadic, based on the schedules of volunteers and plankton events. This data is not good for time series analysis. 

-Data errors: There were some instances where a sample was entered twice into the database.  We tried to remove these errors, but some may remain.

-Duplicate samples: In some instances, a sample was tested twice. There may be some instances of duplicate data in the database. We tried to remove these duplicates, but some may remain.

-Sentinel mussels are mussels that have been placed in bags at a specific location (usually on a pier or buoy) for the purpose of collecting samples.
